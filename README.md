# Slurm Wait Reporter

This includes a daemon to monitor job wait times, where jobs blocked by other jobs from the same user are excluded, and a reporting script.

Built with the assistance of Claude.AI

YMMV, this is incomplete at this time. The easiest way to run this is with Anaconda as it will have all the required packages.
